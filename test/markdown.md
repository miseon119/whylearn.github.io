# Nvidia Developement

## NVIDIA Isaac Sim

> Isaac Sim is a *robotics simulation application* and *synthetic data generation tool*. Within Isaac Sim, you can program, train and test any robot design. The simulation environment enables the creation of photorealistic worlds filled with specific objects that the robot can interact with.

**Synthetic Data Generation**

> Isaac Sim has built-in support for a variety of sensor types that are important in training perception models. These sensors include RGB, depth, bounding boxes, and segmentation.

> Output synthetic data** in the KITTI format. This data can then be used directly with the NVIDIA Transfer Learning Toolkit to enhance model performance with use case-specific data.
