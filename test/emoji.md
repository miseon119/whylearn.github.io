## Calculate the Camera Motion

Case 1: camera is monocular (2D-2D)

we only know the 2D pixel coordinates, so the problem is to estimate the motion according to two sets of 2D points. This
problem is solved by **epipolar geometry**.

Case 2: camera is binocular, RGB-D, or the distance is obtained by some method

problem is to estimate the motion according to two sets of 3D points. This problem is usually solved by **ICP**.


Case 3: If one set is 3D and one set is 2D, we get some 3D points and their projection positions on the camera, and we can also estimate the cameraâ€™s pose. This problem is solved by **PnP**.
